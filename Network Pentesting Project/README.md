# Network Penetration Testing Project

This project demonstrates a comprehensive network penetration testing process to identify vulnerabilities and assess the security posture of a network. The report includes findings, exploitation methods, and recommendations for mitigating risks.

---

## Objective
The primary goal of this project was to:
- Conduct a thorough security assessment of the target network.
- Identify misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and potential attack vectors.
- Provide actionable recommendations to strengthen the network's security.

---

## Methodology
The following steps were carried out during the assessment:
1. **Reconnaissance:**
   - Used tools like `Nmap` and `Netdiscover` for network scanning and discovery.
2. **Enumeration:**
   - Gathered details about open ports, services, and configurations.
3. **Exploitation:**
   - Leveraged tools like `Metasploit` to exploit identified vulnerabilities.
   - Conducted manual verification of findings to ensure accuracy.
4. **Reporting:**
   - Documented findings, risk levels, and mitigation steps in a detailed report.

## Tools Used
- **Nmap:** For network scanning and service detection.
- **Wireshark:** For packet analysis and network monitoring.
- **Metasploit:** To exploit vulnerabilities and test attack scenarios.
- **Nessus:** For automated vulnerability scanning.
