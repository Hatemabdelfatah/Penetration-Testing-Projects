# Web Application Penetration Testing Project

This project involves testing a web application for vulnerabilities following the OWASP Top 10 guidelines. The report details the vulnerabilities identified, exploitation methods, and recommended fixes to enhance the application's security.

---

## Objective
The primary goal of this project was to:
- Identify security weaknesses in a web application.
- Exploit vulnerabilities to demonstrate potential impacts.
- Provide mitigation strategies to improve application security.

---

## Methodology
The following steps were carried out during the assessment:
1. **Reconnaissance:**
   - Collected publicly available information about the web application.
2. **Static and Dynamic Testing:**
   - Conducted automated scans using tools like `Burp Suite` and `OWASP ZAP`.
3. **Exploitation:**
   - Manually tested for vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, XSS, and CSRF.
   - Demonstrated the impact of successful exploitation.
4. **Reporting:**
   - Documented findings, severity levels, and remediation recommendations.

## Tools Used
- **Burp Suite:** For web vulnerability scanning and manual testing.
- **OWASP ZAP:** For automated vulnerability analysis.
- **Nikto:** To detect common misconfigurations and security issues.
- **SQLmap:** For SQL Injection exploitation.

---

## Results
- Identified critical vulnerabilities, including:
  - SQL Injection
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Suggested secure coding practices and configuration changes.

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- Proficiency in identifying OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
- Use of automated and manual penetration testing techniques.
- Clear documentation of technical findings and mitigation strategies.
